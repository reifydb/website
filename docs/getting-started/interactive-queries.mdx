# Interactive Queries

Learn how to query data in ReifyDB with interactive examples. You can run these queries directly in your browser!

## Basic Queries

### SELECT Statement

The most fundamental query in ReifyDB is the SELECT statement. Try running this query to see all users:

<InlineEditor
  query="Map {1}"
/>

### Filtering with WHERE

You can filter results using the WHERE clause:

<InlineEditor
  query="SELECT name, email 
FROM users 
WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com'"
/>

## Joining Tables

ReifyDB supports various types of joins to combine data from multiple tables:

<InlineEditor
  query="SELECT u.name, p.title
FROM users u
JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE p.published = true"
/>

## Aggregation

Use aggregation functions to summarize your data:

<InlineEditor
  query="SELECT u.name, COUNT(p.id) as post_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
ORDER BY post_count DESC"
/>

## Conditional Logic

ReifyDB supports CASE statements for conditional logic:

<InlineEditor
  query="SELECT 
  title,
  CASE 
    WHEN published = true THEN 'Published'
    ELSE 'Draft'
  END as status
FROM posts"
/>

## Multiple Statements

You can run multiple SQL statements in a single execution. Each statement produces its own result table:

<InlineEditor
  query={`-- Get all users
SELECT * FROM users;

  -- Get all published posts
  SELECT title, published
  FROM posts
  WHERE published = true;

  -- Count posts per user
  SELECT u.name, COUNT(p.id) as post_count
  FROM users u
  LEFT JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
  GROUP BY u.id, u.name;`}
/>

## Try Your Own Queries

The examples above are fully editable! You can:
- Modify the queries directly in the editor
- Add or remove statements
- See results for each statement separately
- Reset to the original query if needed
